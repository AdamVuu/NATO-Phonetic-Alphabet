# NATO-Phonetic-Alphabet

This project is for me to learn an OOP through Java. 

## Requirements

The requirement for tihs project is for me to play a game.

Part I: the basic game

When you start a game, the program shows you a random letter from the alphabet

There is a textbox for you to type in the correct phonetic word for that letter, and press enter.

if you get it right it goes hooray!and takes you to a new letter

if you get it wrong it quickly shows you the correct answer before moving to a new letter

when a round is complete it shows your score (you can decide the length of a round).
