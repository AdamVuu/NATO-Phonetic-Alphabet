# NATO-Phonetic-Alphabet

This project is for me to learn an OOP through Java.

## Requirements

The requirement for tihs project is for me to play a game.

Part I: the basic game

When you start a game, the program shows you a random letter from the alphabet

There is a textbox for you to type in the correct phonetic word for that letter,
and press enter.

if you get it right it goes hooray!and takes you to a new letter

if you get it wrong it quickly shows you the correct answer before moving to a
new letter

when a round is complete it shows your score (you can decide the length of a
round).

## Additional fun requirements

Part II: test for speed

You're not truly trained in the phonetic alphabet until you have instantaneous
recall. So don't count an answer correct unless the user types in the correct
answer quickly enough. I think I set mine to something like 2-3 seconds or
something like that.

## Would be Very Nice

Part III: close counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and this game

The point is to know the phonetic word that matches the letter, not to be an
excellent typist. If the user makes a spelling mistake, but it's obvious what
word they were going for, that should count right?

So, implement the Levenshtein distance algorithm so that if the user gets one or
two letters wrong, their answer will still count.

Improve it further by also implementing Soundex Part IV: Ultimate Phonetic
Tester

A neural algorithm that models your own thinking process exactly. You don't have
to type anything as the program already knows what you will type before you even
begin the test.

Ok I'm just kidding about this one but the others are all very good ways to get
going.
